### Projects I have created on fullstack and frontend with some great modern framework and libraries like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

***

### <strong>NOTE</strong>: if you just need one folder from this repo and don't want to download the <bold>FULL</bold> repository so, you can get that from here [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home). Just paste the full url like this <code>/Intersteller-AI/web-projects/tree/main/Frontend/project_you_want_to_download</code> and your folder will be downloaded.

***

#### If you want to use projects so, just clone the repository and after saving it open up the folder and type <code>npm install --legacy-peer-deps</code> and then type <code>npm run dev</code> if the project is belongs to the vite or if it is belongs to the react folder just type <code>npm start</code>.

# Happy Coding ðŸ˜‡ðŸŒ .
