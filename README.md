### Projects I have created on frontend and backend with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or with some great modern framework and libraries like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and Bootstrap.

### If you want to use projects so, just clone the repository and after saving it open up the folder and type <code>npm install</code> and then type <code>npm run dev </code> if the project is belongs to the vite or if it is belongs to the react folder just type <code>npm start</code>.
