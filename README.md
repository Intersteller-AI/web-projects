## Projects I have created on frontend and backend with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or with some great modern framework and libraries like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## <strong>NOTE</strong>: if you just need one folder from this repo and don't want to download the full repository so, you can get that from here [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home). Just paste the full url like this and your folder will be downloaded.

## If you want to use projects so, just clone the repository and after saving it open up the folder and type <code>npm install</code> and then type <code>npm run dev</code> if the project is belongs to the vite or if it is belongs to the react folder just type <code>npm start</code>.
